Planning: 

- Make website percenages instead of pixes ?? change tile/change maybe links()
- Figure out to do boxes and positioning those boxes(CSS GRID 2d layout)
 or centering and positioning normally

- Fill up pages according to planned theme layout 
- Extra stuff(shopping  cart idea for records and stuff)
- Scroll through (Parallax)
