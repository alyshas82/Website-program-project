   <h2> Chopin: <br> <br>"The pianist's composer"</h2>
     <br> <br> 
     <p> Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) was a brilliant Polish composer widely known for his creative and innovative piano pieces of classical music, which bring to life an feeling of solitude and appreciation. He was best known for utilizing national styles such as (mazurka) and reinventing them into commercially impacting pieces.<br> <br>

      Chopin’s passion for the piano started from early childhood, as his first concert took place in his 8th year of life, after creating his first composition at age 7. In total, he led approximately 30 concerts in his fruitful but short life.  His works impacted pianists all over the world, and his name is often remembered as a classic composer among orchestras of the highest grade. </p> <br> <br> <br>
